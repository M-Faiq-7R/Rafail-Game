✈️ Jet Game — Pygame

A simple yet fun airplane dodging game built using Python and Pygame.
Control your jet, avoid enemy aircraft, and keep increasing your score as long as you survive!

🎮 Gameplay

You control a fighter jet at the bottom of the screen.

Enemy jets fly across the screen from right to left.

Avoid collision — if you collide, the game ends.

Your score increases each time an enemy plane passes off the screen.
